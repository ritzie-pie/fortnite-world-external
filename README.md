# fortnite-world-external
fortnite external with an extensive cache & world esp

this project may look like an familiar source, it is based off a based i made called project mop the floor. however this source is no longer a base xD. ps: to who ever leaked project mop da floor with no credits to me kys(keep yourself safe)
if you are looking for a source to learn from to futher expand your knowledge you came to the right place, this is not a shitty base with 2 features
this source is messy and poor code however it has concepts every external maker should learn. it has many tricks of optimzation you can learn from
I made this source early 2023 and scratched it after months of working on it to start fresh so its just been sitting on my pc
Im only uploading because I have decidaded a year to constantly making externals and filling it to the brim with my newest knowledge and as my knowledge improves i realize the code i made was shit and start from scratch again, i have since recoded this project 4 times and each time it gets expotenitally better
my advice is to do the same if you want to learn and grow, start by doing what you can and constantly improving
chears mate
